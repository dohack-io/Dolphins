## Description
Dolphins (Dortmund local politics help in network solution) is an application which simplifies the exchange between citizens and politicians. Until today, many documents were distributed in analog paper format, usually with long shipment times. Dolphins enables an easy, paperless, direct hosting and display of the documents. It also encourages younger citizens to participate.

It is possible to registrate users and log in. Authorized people can upload files. Files can be looked up and displayed either by menu path or an advanced search option.
## Built with
* Java
* Spring Boot Web
* Spring Boot JPA
* Postgres 10.1
* JavaScript

## What benefit will your work bring in smart city context?
Dolphins promotes the participation in local politics and supports a democratic exchange between citizens and politicans.
It is supposed to lower the inhibitions of participation and connects people to their city and work on changing it to the better.
It also protects the environment by digitalizing the previously analog documents.

## What were challenges you encountered and Lessons Learned?
Our main challenge was building the interface between our Java backend and our JavaScript frontend. none of our team members has ever worked on an inteerface like this so we faced problems we did not know how to interpret and solve. We also needed to learn how to commicate each other problems and requirements effectivley to each other as we needed to work on both ends of client server communication.

## What's next for your project?
As this is mainly a prototype, we need to work at seamless interplay between the components. We also want to implement a comment function as already implemented as an functionless part of the website. There should also be restricted documents which are only available for a subgroup.
